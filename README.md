#  Smart Classroom and Timetable Scheduling System

A web-based Smart Timetable Scheduling System built using **Python** and **Flask**.  
This system automatically allocates classrooms and time slots to subjects based on faculty availability and room capacity constraints.

---

##  Features

- Add multiple Teachers
- Add multiple Classrooms
- Add multiple Subjects
- Automatic timetable generation
- Faculty availability & free slot handling
- Classroom capacity validation
- Professional Web UI
- Dynamic form inputs (Add / Remove rows)
- Constraint-based scheduling logic

---

## How It Works

### Information Storage
The system stores structured academic data using:
- Dictionaries (Faculty & Classrooms)
- Lists of Objects (Subjects)

### Information Retrieval
During scheduling, the system:
- Searches faculty availability
- Checks free time slots
- Verifies classroom capacity
- Prevents slot conflicts
- Allocates valid slots dynamically

### Scheduling Rules
1. Faculty must be available
2. Faculty must be free
3. Classroom must have sufficient capacity
4. Time slot must not already be allocated

## Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Flask
- HTML5

##  Installation & Setup

### 1. Clone Repository

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smart-timetable-system.git
cd smart-timetable-system
```

---

### 2. Create Virtual Environment

```
python -m venv venv
```

Activate it:

**Windows**
```
venv\Scripts\activate
```

**Mac/Linux**
```
source venv/bin/activate
```

---

### 3. Install Dependencies

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If requirements.txt does not exist, run:
```
pip install flask
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

---

### 4. Run Application

```
python app.py
```

Open in browser:
```
